            <h3>Grade 11 General Mathematics | Second Quarter Overview</h3>
            <p><strong>Subject:</strong> General Mathematics</p>
            <p><strong>Grade Level:</strong> 11</p>
            <p><strong>Quarter:</strong> Second Quarter, SY 2025-2026</p>
            <p><strong>Class Schedule:</strong> 4 sessions per week, 1 hour (60 minutes) per session</p>

            <h4>Performance Standards</h4>
            <p>By the end of the quarter, the learners are able to present solutions to real-life problems that require measurements and conversions (such as designing a garden, cooking recipes, or building a model). Learners apply trigonometry and geometric concepts to estimate measurements and construct three-dimensional objects, understanding their shapes and volumes for practical uses like product packaging, furniture, and construction.</p>
            
            <h4>Performance Tasks Overview</h4>
            <h5>Performance Task #1: The Green Campus Initiative - Design Phase</h5>
            <p>In groups of 4-5, students will be assigned a specific, underutilized area of the school campus. Their task is to create a detailed landscape design proposal for this area, focusing on accurate measurement, scaled drawings, and calculations of perimeter and area.</p>

            <h5>Performance Task #2: The Green Campus Initiative - Build & Budget Phase</h5>
            <p>Continuing from PT #1, the same groups will now turn their design into a practical project plan. This phase focuses on volume, surface area, trigonometry, and creating a detailed budget by researching the real-world costs of materials.</p>

            <h4>I. Detailed Instructions for Students</h4>
            <h5>Project Title: The Green Campus Initiative - Design Phase</h5>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Welcome, junior landscape architects! Your group has been selected by the school administration to help beautify our campus. Your task is to create a practical and beautiful design proposal for an underutilized space. This project will test your skills in measurement, geometry, and scale drawing.</p>
            <p><strong>Your Goal:</strong> To produce a short, professional report that proposes a new landscape design, including a scaled drawing, precise calculations, and a clear justification for your choices.</p>
            
            <h5>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Site Inspection & Measurement (The "Before"):</strong> Visit your assigned site. Accurately measure the overall dimensions and note any existing features. Create a rough sketch with all measurements labeled.</li>
                <li><strong>Brainstorming & Design (The "Vision"):</strong> As a group, brainstorm how you want to transform the space. Consider function, aesthetics, and elements like lawns, pathways, and flower beds.</li>
                <li><strong>Creating the Scaled Blueprint (The "Plan"):</strong> On graph paper, create a formal, scaled drawing of your proposed design. State the scale clearly (e.g., 1 cm = 0.5 m). Label everything and include a legend.</li>
                <li><strong>Mathematical Calculations (The "Proof"):</strong> On a separate sheet, present the following calculations with formulas and step-by-step solutions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Total perimeter and total area of the entire space.</li>
                        <li>Area of each individual element in your design (e.g., lawn, pathway).</li>
                        <li>Perimeter/circumference of relevant elements (e.g., border for a flower bed).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Design Justification (The "Why"):</strong> Write a short paragraph (3-5 sentences) explaining your design choices and how they improve the space.</li>
                <li><strong>Final Report Assembly:</strong> Compile a neat report with a Title Page, the Scaled Blueprint, the Calculation Sheet, and the Design Justification.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>I. Detailed Instructions for Students</h4>
            <h5>Project Title: The Green Campus Initiative - Build & Budget Phase</h5>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Congratulations on completing the design phase! Now it's time to see if your design is practical and affordable. You will calculate materials needed, solve a real-world trigonometry problem, and create a complete budget.</p>
            <p><strong>Your Goal:</strong> To produce a project folder containing a calculations report and a budget spreadsheet that details the costs and materials required to bring your landscape design to life.</p>
            
            <h5>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Volume Calculations (The "Materials"):</strong> Using your PT#1 design, calculate the volume of materials needed (e.g., cubic meters of soil for a raised garden bed). Show your formula (V = Area of Base × height) and calculations.</li>
                <li><strong>3D Object Design & Calculations (The "Feature"):</strong> Design one simple 3D object for your space (e.g., a rectangular planter box). Create a sketch with dimensions. Calculate its Surface Area (for painting/finishing) and its Volume/Capacity. Show all formulas and calculations.</li>
